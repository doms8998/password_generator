# password_generator
This code takes username and user date of birth as input from the user and creates a 16-digit, strong password out of it with symbols, capital letters and small letters. 
   The provided Python code generates a strong password based on the user's name and date of birth. Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. It imports the `random` and `string` modules. The `random` module is used for shuffling characters, and the `string` module provides a collection of characters that can be used in the password.

2. The `generate_strong_password` function is defined, which takes two arguments: `name` and `dob` (date of birth).

3. In this function:
   - It creates a list of characters to choose from, which includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. These characters are stored in the `characters` variable.
   - It shuffles the `characters` list to randomize the order of characters.

4. The password is generated by concatenating the user's name and date of birth.

5. If the resulting password is less than 16 characters in length, it pads the password with random characters from the shuffled `characters` list until it reaches 16 characters.

6. If the password is longer than 16 characters (due to very long names or dates of birth), it truncates it to 16 characters to ensure the final password is exactly 16 characters long.

7. The generated strong password is then returned by the function.

8. The user is prompted to enter their name and date of birth using the `input` function.

9. The `generate_strong_password` function is called with the provided user inputs, and the resulting strong password is stored in the `strong_password` variable.

10. Finally, the script prints the generated strong password to the console.

This code allows users to create a strong password using their name and date of birth and ensures that the password is a mix of characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols) while also being exactly 16 characters long.
